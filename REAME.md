This is an example of how to use [Clyde Dialogue](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini/godot-clyde-dialogue) in Godot.

To see it done step-by-step check [this video]().

## About Clyde

Clyde is a language for writing game dialogues. It supports branching dialogues, translations and interfacing with your game through variables and events.

For details on how to write using Clyde check [this file](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini/clyde/blob/master/LANGUAGE.md).

If you want to test the language without having to install anything, try the [online editor](https://viniciusgerevini.github.io/clyde/).

## About this example

As Clyde is only a dialogue engine, it is totally up to you how you build your interface or how to use the plugin.

This example shows a basic integration with Clyde, covering most of the features in a simple way.

Dialogues are started from `./examples/main.gd`. All integration code leaves in `./dialogue_system/dialogue.gd`, which are exposed as a singleton.
